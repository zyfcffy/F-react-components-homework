# Setup

## Start Server
Server started at http://localhost:1234 . Parcel is used for bundler. 

```
yarn start
```
     
## Run Jest Test
Jest is used for Unit Test.

```
yarn test
```

## Run Cypress
Cypress is used for E2E test. There are two examples at `cypress/integration`:

- index_spec.js
    
    It renders index page without any stub for API request.
- index_with_request_spec.js

    It renders index page with stub for API request. `API` constant should be changed to the correct url once decided.

```
yarn cypress
```

### Open Cypress CLI

```
yarn cypress:open
```

### Run Cypress Test

```
yarn cypress:run
```
